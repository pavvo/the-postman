# The Postman

The Postman is a simple, React based web application that allows users to read posts and comments associated with those posts.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pavvo/the-postman
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd the-postman
```

We are using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager for this project. If you don't have pnpm installed, you can install it by running:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

And finally, start the application:

```bash
pnpm start:dev
```
